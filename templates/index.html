<h1 style="background-color:tomato;">New flavors of Week</h1>
 </div>
 <h3 style="color:darkblue;margin-top:40px;">Mochi Ice-Cream</h3>
 <p style="color:darkblue;margin-top:20px;">Of course, Mochi Ice Cream is our favorite. We take premium ice cream and wrap it in delicious, authentic Mochi dough, allowing you to ditch the spoon and take your ice cream with you wherever you go.</p>
 <h3 style="color:darkblue;margin-top:40px;">Gelato</h3>
 <p style="color:darkblue;margin-top:20px;">   Gelato, Ice Cream’s Italian cousin, is made with whole milk, without using added cream. This makes the milkfat percentage much lower than traditional ice cream. Also, gelato is often made without eggs and stabilizers. While it is being churned, there is little to no air whipped into it, leaving a dense, thick texture.</p>
 <h3 style="color:darkblue;margin-top:40px;">Frozen Yogurt</h3>
 <p style="color:darkblue;margin-top:20px;">  Frozen yogurt, or Fro-Yo, is a very popular form of ice cream right now. This frozen treat is made using some of the same ingredients as ice cream, but with a much lower percentage of fat. There is also yogurt mixed in, which gives it more of a tart taste.</p>
 <h3 style="color:darkblue;margin-top:40px;">Sorbet</h3>
 <p style="color:darkblue;margin-top:20px;"> Sorbet is frozen treat that contains little to no dairy. Because it is made by using frozen berries and sweetened water, it is very light in texture and flavor.</p>
 <h3 style="color:darkblue;margin-top:40px;">Sherbet</h3>
 <p style="color:darkblue;margin-top:20px;">Sherbet, similarly to sorbet, is a fruit-based frozen dessert, but it does contain dairy. It is made with fruit juice, milk or cream, egg whites, and in some cases, gelatin.</p>
